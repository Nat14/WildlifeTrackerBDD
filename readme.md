##Wildlife Tracker

The Forest Service is considering a proposal from a timber company to clear-cut an old-growth forest of virgin Douglas fir just outside of Portland. Before they give the go-ahead, they need to do an environmental impact study. They've asked you and your pair to build an app so that the rangers can report wildlife sightings.

This is part of SQL and Active Record week. Week6 on LEARN Academy bootcamp.
