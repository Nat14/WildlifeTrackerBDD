##Wildlife Tracker

The Forest Service is considering a proposal from a timber company to clear-cut an old-growth forest of virgin Douglas fir just outside of Portland. Before they give the go-ahead, they need to do an environmental impact study. They've asked you and your pair to build an app so that the rangers can report wildlife sightings.
